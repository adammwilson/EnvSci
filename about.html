## Course Description

Environmental science is the interdisciplinary study of the physical, chemical, and biological systems that sustain life on our planet.  In this course we will explore current environmental challenges such as the conservation of biodiversity, the sustainable production of energy, and the implications of human population growth. The processes of scientific inquiry and discovery will be emphasized through investigation of specific case studies and the critical evaluation of the underlying scientific evidence.
